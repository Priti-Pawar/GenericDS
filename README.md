•	This project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data structure.
•	We provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental operations ass well as advanced operations on linear, non linear data structures in an object oriented way.
•	provide the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality of any type of data types.
•	All the object oriented design policies are used in this project.
